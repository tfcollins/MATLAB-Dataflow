%% Testing
% Current testing only builds and runs against C++ code.
% MATLAB testing doesn't really work with travis-ci, so
% we just look at the C++ code.
%
% Current Tests:
% - TestFlow: 2 block test (1 sink, 1 source), just to 
%   make sure everthing will compile, run, and exit w/o error
%   -- File: src/testFlowMP.cpp
